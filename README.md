# blue-app-ssh-agent

A simple PGP and SSH agent for Ledger Blue, supporting prime256v1 and ed25519 keys.

This agent is compatible with the third party SSH/PGP host client from Roman Zeyde available at https://github.com/romanz/trezor-agent - it is recommended to use it for extra functionalities

You can also use the SSH functionalities with the following instructions using Python 2 :

Install dependencies first, for example in a Debian-based distro you would do:

```
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
pip install ledgerblue
```

Then run getPublicKey.py to get the public key in SSH format, to be added to your authorized keys on the target

```
python getPublicKey.py
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAA....
```

Run agent.py, providing the base64 encoded key retrieved earlier 

```
python agent.py --key AAAA....
```

Export the environment variables in your shell to use it

You can also set the derivation path from the master seed by providing it with the --path parameter.
